# README-GENERATOR
Module 9 Activity
 ## Description
  This application is a readme file generator. This application enables a user to create a readme file by way of asking prompt questions, and using the users answers to create the readme file. To build this application, I utilized node.js. Building this application, I faced challenges creating proper functions to execute the objective of providing the user with prompt questions, as well, I faced challenges with implimenting the license badge on the readme file.
  ## Installation
  To run this application, install VSCode, open an integrated terminal and run nmp i. Additionally, install markdown extension.
  ## Usage
  To use this application, open VSCode, open an integrated terminal, run nmp i, input node index.js in the terminal, then answer the prompted questions. After all questions are answered, a readme file will populate. Open the read me file in markdown and then open that in a browser to view your readme. 
  ## Credits
  For this project, I utilized starter code provided by The University of Utah Coding Bootcamp. Additionally, I utilized code and ideas from https://w3schools.com, https://youtube.com, https://stackoverflow.com, and as well, I received help building this application from University of Utah Coding Bootcamp tutor Patrick Meehan, and TA's Brandon Ashby and Jessica Lane
